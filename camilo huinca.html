            <p>
                Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, 
                content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself.
                <br>
                Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career 
                between graphic design and painting.
                Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style,
                having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains.
                In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where 
                he concentrates on graphic design projects
                in “a more commercial way”.
                <br>
                However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, 
                “to be able to generate a communication
                method based on simplicity and synthesis, 
                with few tools and colours. I am interested 
                in identifying people's behaviour, portraying activities,
                intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing
                the amount of detail in a composition.”
                <br>
                Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits,
                often depicting scenic bus routes, art galleries
                and public figures in his own psychedelically 
                shaped style. “Within my work I try to reproduce real moments
                from an innocent and impartial perspective.”
